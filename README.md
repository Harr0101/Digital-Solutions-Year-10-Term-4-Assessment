Game Description
You wake up in a storage room filled with boxes. Closer examination reveals that there are many robots in the room. There is a weapon next to you, and a note, saying to get out. Following the only exit from the room reveals a long corridor going south. On the way south, you notice the main door, but it’s locked and needs a key.
The game is played through a text-based interface. There are the many standard commands of move, look, examine, take, fight, and talk. Watch is also included to repeatedly examine an object. Some items can perform actions when held. To activate an item, type the name of the item and then ‘use’ or the specific command word.
